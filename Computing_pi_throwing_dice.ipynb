    "The number $\\pi$ is a mathematical constant. Originally defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics. It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter __\"$\\pi$\"__ since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as \"pi\". It is also called Archimedes' constant.\n",

    "The idea is extremely simple. If you throw a large number of darts, then the **probability of a dart falling inside the circle is just the ratio of the area of the circle to that of the area of the square board**. With the help of basic mathematics, you can show that this ratio turns out to be pi/4. So, to get pi, you just multiply that number by 4.\n",
